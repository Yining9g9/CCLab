                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Emotibion belongs to the Exocoetidae. Exocoetidae, or flying fish, are marine animals that can glide
                    above the water using their wing-like fins.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>This type of creature lives in water, but only in remote and barren areas. Thatâ€™s because it can
                    change the temperature of the water, making it hard for other animals to survive.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Spindle-shaped heart/body. And a pair of wings. The heart is the body. The shape and color could
                    change based on the environment or the interaction with humans. The wings can help it move quickly
                    in the water and air. The movement and the color of the wings can change, too.</p>

                Emotibion is a unique creature with a spindle-shaped body that houses its heart. It is small and tends
                to live in groups, often forming clusters with one central individual and two others orbiting it. These
                creatures are territorial, considering entire water bodies as their domain. When the center of the
                domain is disturbed, they exhibit a striking color change from blue-green to yellow-purple, and their
                wings shift from yellow to red. This change is accompanied by the release of a significant amount of
                heat, which can make the water too hot for survival and cause erratic behavior. In a laboratory setting,
                Emotibion shows a tendency to bounce repeatedly within a confined area. They have a strong protective
                instinct towards their territory, reacting immediately to any intrusion. Scientists have attempted to
                clone Emotibion, but the clone has shown disorganized behavior and is not yet functional. If provoked
                multiple times, Emotibion may develop sharp protrusions for self-defense.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Interaction with
                Emotibion should be handled with care to avoid triggering their defense mechanisms. They should not be
                disturbed, especially the central individual in a group, as this can lead to significant changes in
                their behavior and the environment. In the laboratory, scientists are observing their behavior within a
                confined space, noting their repetitive bouncing and reactions to territory intrusion. The goal is to
                understand their social dynamics and responses to various stimuli without provoking them. This approach
                can provide valuable insights into their biology and potential for further study, including their
                cloning and behavior under stress.
